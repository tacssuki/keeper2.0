# Keeper 2.0

Keeper 2.0 is a lightweight version of "Google Keep", designed and developed as a frontend react application. This project is an enhanced and upgraded version of Dr. Angela Yu's project from App Brewery.

## Features

- Welcome page
- Login page
- Register page

Please note, however, that the system currently does not have a backend, so these pages act as placeholders for now.

- Dark Mode: The app comes with a dark mode feature that is set as default. Users have the option of switching this off if they prefer to operate in a different theme.

## Roadmap

- Make It Responsive
- I'm currently planning to add a backend using Node.js and Express, with email verification for authentication and still deciding whether to use SQL or NoSQL databases for data management. Stay tuned for upcoming enhancements!
- Google and Facebook OAuth2.0
